 ****************************| KEY CONCEPT OF SYSTEM DESIGNING |********************************
                              ---------------------------------

Scalability--> is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of load by adding resources to the system.

Availability--> refers to the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when required.

CAP theorem-->

Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
According to the theorem, a distributed system can only guarantee two out of these three properties at any given time.

important-CP AND AP

ACID-->

Atomicity: All parts of a transaction must succeed, or none of it should happen. It's "all or nothing."
Example: If you transfer money between bank accounts, either both the debit and credit happen, or neither does.

Consistency: A transaction must move the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all rules (like data types, constraints).
Example: After a bank transaction, the total amount of money in all accounts remains the same.

Isolation: Transactions should happen independently. One transaction shouldnâ€™t affect another.
Example: Two people booking movie tickets should not interfere with each other's bookings.

Durability: Once a transaction is completed, its changes are permanent, even if the system crashes.
Example: After confirming a bank transfer, the transaction remains successful even if the power goes out right after.



A load balancer is a system or device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed.
It improves application performance, reliability, and availability by balancing the workload and preventing server overload.
If one server fails, the load balancer can redirect traffic to other healthy servers, ensuring continued service.



1. Latency

 it's the time between sending a request and receiving a response.
 For example, in a video call, latency would be the delay between when you speak and when the other person hears your voice.

2.ThroughPut

 throughput is the number of requests or transactions a system can handle in a given period.
 It's like measuring how many tasks or data points a system can process per second or minute.

Note-> low latency and high throughput for a good system design


Redundancy v/s Replication

Redundancy ensures that the system remains operational even if a component fails.
For instance, having multiple servers or power supplies ensures that if one fails, others can take over.

Replication ensures that data is available from multiple locations or servers, enhancing access speed and reliability
Replication strategies (e.g., synchronous or asynchronous) help in managing data consistency across multiple copies.
This is important when you need to ensure that all copies of data are updated correctly.


//Replication: Making extra copies of data to keep it available and consistent across different locations.

//Redundancy: Having backup parts or systems ready to take over if something fails, so everything keeps working smoothly.


Can RDBMS scalling horizontally?
Yes, RDBMS can be horizontally scaled, but it is typically more complex compared to NoSQL databases.

Horizontal scaling in RDBMS is possible through methods like:

 Sharding:Sharding is a method of distributing data across multiple servers to improve performance and scalabilit
 Replication with Read-Write Splitting:
 Distributed SQL Databases:
 Clustering:

Normalisation vs DeNormalisation

Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
It involves breaking down tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the complexity of queries and improve read performance.
It involves adding redundant data to improve efficiency.


Web Server

web server acts as the gateway between the client and the backend infrastructure, routing requests, processing them,
and sending back the necessary data or content.

Example in a Backend System:
Client Request: A user logs in on a website.
Web Server: Receives the login request.
Backend Server: The web server sends the request to a backend application server (e.g., a Python Flask or Java Spring Boot service).
Database Interaction: The backend server queries a database to validate the user credentials.
Response: The web server sends the appropriate response (success or error) back to the user.


CAP theorem

Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
According to the theorem, a distributed system can only guarantee two out of these three properties at any given time.

Sharding is a technique used to split large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces, called "shards." Each shard holds a portion of the data, and they can be stored on different servers. This helps improve performance and allows the system to handle more data without slowing down.

Imagine a library that has too many books for one bookshelf. Instead of cramming all the books onto a single shelf, you split them up into several shelves (shards). Now, when someone wants a specific book, they only need to search one shelf instead of going through the entire collection, making the process faster.

Sharding helps distribute data across multiple servers, so even when the database grows, the system remains efficient.
