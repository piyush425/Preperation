/**
 * The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified
 * interface to a larger and more complex system.
 * It hides the complexities of subsystems and provides a unified interface to the client.
 *
 * Real-Life Analogy üè¢
 * Imagine a hotel reception:
 *
 * Instead of dealing with multiple departments (room booking, food service, housekeeping), you just talk to the receptionist (Facade).
 * The receptionist communicates with the right departments internally.
 *
 * When to Use?
 * ‚úî When you have a complex system with many interdependent classes.
 * ‚úî When you want to provide a simplified interface to clients.
 * ‚úî When you want to decouple clients from the underlying system.
