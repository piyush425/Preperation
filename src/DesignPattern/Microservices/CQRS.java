/**
 * CQRS is a design pattern that separates the write operations (commands) from the read operations (queries) in an application.
 * This pattern helps optimize performance, scalability, and data consistency by treating read and write operations differently.
 *
 * Why Use CQRS?
 *
 * In traditional systems, a single model is used for both reading and writing data, which can lead to performance issues when dealing with large or complex data.
 * By separating them, you can tune the read and write sides independently to meet different needs.

/**
 * Real-World Use Cases of CQRS
 *
 * CQRS is particularly useful in applications where read and write operations have different performance, security, or scalability requirements. Here are some real-world use cases and scenarios where CQRS is commonly applied:
 *
 * 1. E-Commerce Platforms
 * Use Case: Managing product catalog, inventory, and order processing.
 * Why CQRS?
 * Write Side: When a new product is added, the Command Model updates the product catalog in the main database.
 * Read Side: Customers frequently search for products. The Query Model uses a read-optimized database (e.g., NoSQL or ElasticSearch) for fast search and filtering.
 * Example: Amazon uses a similar pattern to handle high-frequency reads (product searches) separately from infrequent writes (adding new products or inventory updates).
 *
 *
 * 2. Banking and Financial Systems
 * Use Case: Handling transactions and account balance queries.
 * Why CQRS?
 * Write Side: Commands update account balances and transaction histories in a strongly consistent database.
 * Read Side: Users frequently check account balances. A separate read database handles these requests quickly without locking the main database.
 * Example: A banking application like Revolut might use CQRS to separate transaction processing from balance queries, making balance checks fast and responsive even during peak hours.
 *
 *
 * 3. Event-Driven Systems (e.g., Booking Systems)
 * Use Case: Handling flight, hotel, or ticket bookings.
 * Why CQRS?
 * Write Side: When a booking is made, the command side validates availability, updates the main booking system, and triggers related processes (e.g., payment).
 * Read Side: Users frequently query availability or booking status. A separate read store provides a cached view of current availability.
 * Example: Airline booking systems use CQRS to separate seat availability checks from actual booking commands.
