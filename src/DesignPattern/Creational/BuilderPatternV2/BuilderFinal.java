/**
 * The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
 * It allows you to create different variations of an object without changing its structure.
 *
 * Why use the Builder Pattern?
 * When an object has many optional parameters, using a constructor with too many arguments can be confusing.
 * It improves readability by allowing method chaining.
 * It helps in making objects immutable.
 *
 *
 * Advantages of the Builder Pattern
 * âœ… Readability â€“ No need for long constructors with many parameters.
 * âœ… Immutability â€“ The object is created in a single step, reducing bugs.
 * âœ… Scalability â€“ Easily extendable if new parameters are needed.
 *
 * This pattern is widely used in frameworks like Spring and Lombok (@Builder). ðŸš€
