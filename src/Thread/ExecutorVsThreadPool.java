/**
 *
 * The Executor Framework in Java is a high-level API that simplifies the
 * execution of tasks asynchronously using a pool of threads.
 *
 * ExecutorService is an interface in Javaâ€™s java.util.concurrent package,
 * and ThreadPoolExecutor is one of its implementing classes.
 *
 * Difference:
 * ExecutorService (Interface)
 *
 * It provides higher-level thread pool management.
 * It abstracts thread pool creation and execution.
 * Common methods: submit(), execute(), shutdown(), etc.
 * Examples: Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5), Executors.newCachedThreadPool().
 * ThreadPoolExecutor (Concrete Class)
 *
 * It is a customizable implementation of ExecutorService.
 * Provides fine-grained control over thread pool behavior.
 * Requires parameters like core pool size, max pool size, queue, etc.
