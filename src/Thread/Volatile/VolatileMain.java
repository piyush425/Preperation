 * The volatile keyword in Java ensures that a variable's value is always read from and written to the main memory,
 * rather than from the thread's local cache.
 * This guarantees that changes made to a volatile variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads.
 *
 * Without volatile, a thread might read a stale value from its local cache instead of the most recent value from main memory.

     * Output without volatile:
     *
     * When you run the example without volatile, you might observe that the output seems synchronized or orderly at times.
     * However, itâ€™s essential to note that this does not guarantee consistent behavior. In some cases,
     * Thread 2 might read a stale value from its cache after Thread 1 updates the flag, leading to outputs that do not reflect the most recent updates.
     *
     *
     * Output with volatile:
     * When you include volatile, you might see outputs that seem out of order or not immediately reflecting the latest changes.
     * This is because volatile enforces visibility, meaning that Thread 2 will always read the most recent value from the main memory.
     * However, due to the asynchronous nature of thread execution, the timing might lead to situations where Thread 1 updates the flag, and before Thread 2 reads the updated value, it gets the current state of the flag.
