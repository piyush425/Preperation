/**
 *
 * The system should be able to track and manage multiple weather data points (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
 * Different components (e.g., mobile apps, displays, alert systems) should be able to receive updates when there are changes in the weather data.
 * Components may have different notification needs (e.g., some may only want temperature updates, others may need all weather data).
